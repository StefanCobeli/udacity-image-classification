# Udacity's Image Classification Project

# 1. Introduction
The second project in a series of Deep Learning foundation's projects at Udacity, in which an image classification is built to classify images from the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10 dataset</a>. This dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

# 2. Objective
- [x] Normalize the images and the labels.
- [x] Preprocess the images with one-hot encode.
- [x] Build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
- [x] Observe the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
