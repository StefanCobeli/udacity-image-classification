# Udacity's Image Classification Project

# 1. Introduction
The second project in a series of Deep Learning foundation's projects at Udacity, in which an image classification is built to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects

# 2. Objective
- [ ] Preprocess the images.
- [ ] Normalize the images and the labels.
- [ ] Build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
- [ ] Observe the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
